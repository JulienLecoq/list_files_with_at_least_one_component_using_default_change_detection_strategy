A simple program to list all files in an Angular project that contain at least one component using the default change detection strategy.

To run the program, first install Odin, then build the program, and finally execute it.

Here is the production build command I personally used to run it on my computer:

odin build . -o:speed -vet -strict-style -obfuscate-source-code-locations -disable-assert -no-bounds-check
